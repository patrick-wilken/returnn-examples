Mr President , it is a r@@ are hon@@ our to be given a se@@ con@@ d opportunity to ask questions !
We need to mo@@ ve that agenda forward with great ur@@ gency now .
L@@ a@@ st but not least , we need a long m@@ em@@ ory , for the issue of legislation will c@@ ro@@ p up on the agenda more f@@ re@@ qu@@ ently in the ne@@ ar future .
The Commission atta@@ ches the greatest importance to this , just as you y@@ ourselves do .
Th@@ ere@@ for@@ e , we will have to see how the re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e@@ in@@ g the maximum de@@ g@@ re@@ e of safety can be further im@@ proved .
We see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " them and us " .
H@@ ow could you compl@@ et@@ ely i@@ gn@@ ore a common - I repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional im@@ pact , and which therefore affec@@ ts the economic and social cohesion of Europe ?
It cannot a@@ f@@ for@@ d to remain outside the regional al@@ li@@ an@@ c@@ es being for@@ ged in this area , l@@ est it mis@@ s out on a histor@@ ic opportunity , and the same app@@ li@@ es to our regions in the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an .
Mr President , n@@ ine million cars are sh@@ re@@ d@@ ded and s@@ c@@ ra@@ p@@ p@@ ed every year in Europe .
We now come to the third proposal which is for ' E@@ n@@ vi@@ r@@ on@@ mental dis@@ a@@ st@@ ers in the waters of the D@@ an@@ u@@ be ' , a proposal tabled by the Group of the Gre@@ en@@ s / European F@@ re@@ e A@@ l@@ li@@ ance .
M@@ al@@ t@@ a and C@@ y@@ p@@ ru@@ s have asked to j@@ o@@ in the Community .
It gi@@ ves the impression that they are three min@@ or or in@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fi@@ c@@ ant sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ts wh@@ ere@@ as in fact they are three extremely serious and important sub@@ j@@ ec@@ ts , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political c@@ ou@@ ra@@ g@@ e c@@ ol@@ l@@ ec@@ ti@@ v@@ ely at A@@ m@@ st@@ er@@ da@@ m to deal with them in de@@ p@@ th .
( The Minutes were ap@@ proved )
S@@ im@@ il@@ arly , it cannot be right for just a few Member States wi@@ l@@ l@@ ing to provide help to bear the enti@@ r@@ e b@@ ur@@ den of re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e mis@@ er@@ y on our con@@ ti@@ n@@ ent .
T@@ o@@ day 's decision not to rene@@ w the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .
No@@ w is the time for Europe to put its own h@@ ou@@ se in order ; to in@@ s@@ ti@@ l in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .
I propose that we start the debate immedi@@ ately .
We have more confidence in E@@ u@@ ro@@ just , where pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors from the individu@@ al n@@ ations co@@ oper@@ ate .
In the example which you mentioned , it is only lo@@ gi@@ cal that the te@@ a@@ ch@@ er in a C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c sch@@ o@@ o@@ l should be C@@ a@@ th@@ o@@ li@@ c .
L@@ et me just look at the fi@@ g@@ ur@@ es from the day that the agreement was si@@ gn@@ ed .
In sp@@ ite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the in@@ i@@ ti@@ al proposal , pers@@ on@@ ally , on@@ ce again I de@@ p@@ l@@ ore the fact that the fun@@ ds al@@ located do not mat@@ ch up to the am@@ bi@@ tions expressed and that the concern to s@@ av@@ e money dis@@ pla@@ yed by the Council in this situation is in ru@@ de con@@ tra@@ st to its de@@ c@@ lar@@ ations in favour of the safety of the energy su@@ p@@ p@@ ly , j@@ o@@ b c@@ re@@ ation and environmental protection , challenges that are just as si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fi@@ c@@ ant which we must fa@@ ce up to .
Mr President , I am very g@@ la@@ d that Mrs R@@ an@@ d@@ z@@ i@@ o@@ -@@ P@@ la@@ th mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other spe@@ ak@@ er has done so .
M@@ any v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers from France and other European countries have expressed their so@@ li@@ dar@@ ity by l@@ end@@ ing a hand to the vi@@ c@@ ti@@ ms in the fi@@ el@@ d .
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and Commission for a us@@ e@@ ful and th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation procedure and one that was g@@ o@@ o@@ d-@@ t@@ em@@ per@@ ed all ro@@ un@@ d , which is not always the case .
We have been dis@@ c@@ us@@ s@@ ing the Tobin tax proposal for t@@ w@@ ent@@ y years and y@@ et the question is still t@@ op@@ i@@ cal because we need really con@@ c@@ re@@ te and hon@@ est ans@@ wer@@ s based on ca@@ re@@ ful studies .
W@@ i@@ th@@ in the Committee on Economic and M@@ on@@ et@@ ary Affairs , the Jonckheer report has given r@@ ise to b@@ it@@ ter con@@ tro@@ ver@@ s@@ y on the subject of the oper@@ ation of the market .
Finally , we should make it quite pla@@ in to M@@ al@@ t@@ a that if it w@@ an@@ ts to become a Member of this Community then by the time it acc@@ e@@ des it must apply a standar@@ d in respect of reg@@ is@@ tra@@ tion and f@@ la@@ g state control which compl@@ et@@ ely fu@@ l@@ fi@@ ls our re@@ qui@@ re@@ ments , for the environment is a c@@ om@@ m@@ un@@ al enti@@ ty and not something that we can d@@ i@@ vi@@ de up !
W@@ h@@ i@@ ch national f@@ un@@ d will pay for my end@@ -@@ o@@ f@@ -@@ li@@ f@@ e v@@ e@@ h@@ i@@ c@@ le ?
And y@@ et we o@@ we this to the citizens of Europe .
There is little point in having st@@ re@@ et@@ s which are now w@@ on@@ der@@ fully li@@ t , with new p@@ av@@ em@@ ents , with ne@@ w@@ ly p@@ av@@ ed ro@@ a@@ d su@@ r@@ fac@@ es , all wh@@ it@@ e@@ w@@ a@@ sh@@ ed and be@@ a@@ u@@ ti@@ ful , if we are not able to fi@@ l@@ l them with activity and , therefore , employment .
What we are doing today is ess@@ enti@@ ally a n@@ u@@ is@@ ance .
We are also currently exam@@ ining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a cla@@ s@@ si@@ fi@@ c@@ ation system for do@@ cu@@ ments , made in par@@ ag@@ ra@@ p@@ h 50 of Mr v@@ an H@@ u@@ l@@ ten 's report .
Qu@@ es@@ tion No 12 by ( H@@ -@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0@@ 1 / 9@@ 9 ) :
There is no bac@@ k@@ b@@ one , and no te@@ et@@ h .
Mr President , I am taking the f@@ lo@@ or to express my opinion , dra@@ w@@ n from my ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ce of m@@ un@@ i@@ ci@@ p@@ al administration , that the URBAN projects should , or rather must , have a thre@@ e@@ f@@ ol@@ d purpose : fir@@ stly , to promote the re@@ st@@ or@@ ation of in@@ fra@@ structure and histor@@ ic , ol@@ d and perhaps d@@ i@@ la@@ pi@@ da@@ ted areas of cities .
Commissioner , Mr President , L@@ o@@ th@@ ar was a quite or@@ d@@ in@@ ary na@@ me h@@ i@@ ther@@ to .
The establ@@ is@@ h@@ ment of a European Public Prosecutor ' s O@@ f@@ f@@ i@@ ce and the de@@ fin@@ i@@ tion of offences common to all countries of the Union is d@@ ou@@ b@@ t@@ less a good idea , but it is im@@ possible to consider putting this into practice without having first in@@ tro@@ du@@ c@@ ed a European legal system .
Our group is re@@ vie@@ wing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .
I feel that the French authorities - which have the hon@@ our of h@@ ous@@ ing the European Parliament in S@@ tra@@ s@@ b@@ our@@ g - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate con@@ n@@ ec@@ tions with all the ca@@ p@@ it@@ als of the Union .
. Thank you very much , D@@ ag@@ ma@@ r R@@ o@@ th@@ -@@ B@@ e@@ h@@ r@@ end@@ t , for these questions .
What we need are not just reforms of the W@@ or@@ l@@ d T@@ ra@@ de O@@ r@@ g@@ an@@ is@@ ation and the economic ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ r@@ e - and , si@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ fi@@ c@@ an@@ tly , the President of the Commission for@@ g@@ o@@ t to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ tu@@ r@@ e ; we also need con@@ fi@@ den@@ c@@ e@@ -@@ b@@ u@@ il@@ ding measures for our citizens , who ri@@ gh@@ tly expec@@ t help and support from and in the EU with the in@@ e@@ v@@ it@@ able and pa@@ in@@ ful process of a@@ da@@ p@@ ting to new global ci@@ r@@ cu@@ m@@ st@@ an@@ c@@ es .
T@@ o@@ day , Europe is fac@@ ing a si@@ m@@ i@@ la@@ r ch@@ all@@ en@@ g@@ e , and we know that , just as histor@@ y has been un@@ for@@ gi@@ ving in the past , it will not be for@@ gi@@ ving in the present .
( The President cu@@ t the spe@@ ak@@ er off )
It is re@@ m@@ ar@@ k@@ able that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is d@@ em@@ an@@ d@@ ing any change in the direction taken by monetary union .
States can carry out port in@@ spec@@ tions .
The offi@@ ci@@ als responsible for financial control should be de@@ p@@ l@@ o@@ y@@ ed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the oper@@ a@@ ti@@ on@@ al D@@ i@@ rec@@ t@@ or@@ at@@ es@@ -@@ G@@ en@@ er@@ al , amongst those of their col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es that spend the money , so that they are immedi@@ ately available when problems ar@@ ise and so as to r@@ en@@ der the ch@@ ec@@ ks less p@@ on@@ der@@ ous and ti@@ me@@ -@@ con@@ sum@@ ing .
In many cities in France and E@@ n@@ g@@ l@@ and there are now s@@ lu@@ ms , bre@@ e@@ ding grounds for many s@@ or@@ ts of problems .
In the U@@ K the local in@@ de@@ x of de@@ p@@ ri@@ v@@ ation is a very good example of a wi@@ d@@ ely used standar@@ d and st@@ a@@ ti@@ s@@ ti@@ c to help d@@ et@@ er@@ min@@ e not only EU but national and regional ass@@ is@@ t@@ ance programmes .
I think that this is also the case here , but I think it would be a b@@ it over the to@@ p to spend too much time t@@ al@@ king about these 100 amendments .
At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 4 and 1@@ 9@@ 9@@ 6 , the INTERREG C@@ I@@ P has in@@ c@@ or@@ p@@ or@@ ated new st@@ ran@@ ds contribu@@ ting to the development of trans@@ -@@ European transport and energy dis@@ tri@@ b@@ u@@ tion n@@ et@@ wor@@ ks .
